"Why might you want to create a collaborative playlist? There are lots of reasons, including the following scenarios:

You're creating a playlist for a big event and want input from several people who'll be attending.
You and a group of friends want to put together a playlist that reflects your collective listening habits at this point in time.
You and your spouse or significant other want to create a playlist to listen to jointly while you're traveling together.
You like and trust the musical taste of your friends, and want them to help broaden your own listening choices." -Jan. 2008, Spotify releases collaborative playlists
